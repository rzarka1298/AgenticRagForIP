<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to the field of biological fungicides with a broad range of antifungal activity coming from plant extracts from the order of Brassicales or molecules revealing similar chemical structure. In particular, Applicants surprisingly provided a new usage of a combination of sulfonyl and sulfinyl containing aliphatic glucosinolates, their by-products and synthetic analogues as efficient antifungal compounds with broad spectrum of activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Human population is increasing each year and is about to reach 8.6 billion by 2030. To maintain high levels of food production farmers have to use external treatments, such as: 1) chemical pesticides that have high efficiency, accessible costs, but reveal negative impact on the environment and human health; 2) biological pesticides having no harmful effect on environment, but showing low efficiency (less than 60%, compared to existing chemical pesticide) and high costs. That makes biological pesticides not accessible for many countries and opens possibilities to develop and bring to market novel organic treatments that reveal high efficiency and accessible costs and are environmentally friendly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the last decades, some biological approaches were developed to prevent <i>B. cinerea </i>in the field, e.g. the application of <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>and <i>Trichoderma harzanium</i>, but they are poorly used in farming due to their low efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In western European agriculture, the commonly used bio-preventive fungicides are copper and sulphur. These fungicides are costly to apply due to the need to reapply after each precipitation. In addition, high concentrations of these metals in soil have negative impacts on the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a consequence, there is a need to provide an alternative to these techniques, by being more respectful towards the environment, as well as a highly efficient preventive treatment against fungal pathogens.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Plant fungal pathogens are one of the agronomical treats that lead to severe food loses yearly. The efficiency of fungal pathogens is caused by their easy dispersal in nature, rapid attachment on the host surface and fast germ tube development that promotes penetration in plants. Plants, on the other hand, have developed several defence mechanisms against fungal pathogens e.g. necrotrophs: a) prevention of pathogen penetration; b) increased levels of reactive oxygen species; c) induction of defence hormones, such as jasmonate, ethylene, salicylic and abscisic acid. Additionally, some plants are synthetizing fungitoxic compounds that prevent fungal development on plant surface and stop disease formation. Identification of plant compounds with strong antifungal activity can lead to development of novel biological fungicides that can, potentially, replace currently existing chemical treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Order of Brassicales consists of economically important plants that are broadly distributed and used as food source. This group of plants was shown to have a unique set of secondary metabolites&#x2014;glucosinolates. In the last decades glucosinolates were shown to have anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and insecticidal properties.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example JPH11139949 A (OGAWA KORYO CO LTD) discloses how to obtain an antibacterial-antifungal agent free from strong irritating odour, having a high threshold, low in volatility and having an excellent antibacterial-antifungal activity by compounding a specific [omega]-alkenyl isothiocyanate compound or a specific [omega]-alkylthioalkyl isothiocyanate compound. An [omega]-alkenyl isothiocyanate compound having the formula: CH2 CH(CH2)m NCS [(m)=2-10] (e.g. 3-butenyl isothiocyanate) or an [omega]-alkylthioalkyl isothiocyanate compound having the formula: RS(CH2)n2 NCS [(n)=1-10; R is a 1-4C alkyl](e.g. methylthiomethyl isothiocyanate) is compounded in a food in an amount of 0.01-100 ppm, preferably 1-50 ppm or in an oral hygienic agent in a concentration of about 0.01-100 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Similarly, JPH11246319 A (OGAWA KORYO CO LTD) discloses how to obtain an antimicrobial and antifungal agent that can largely alleviate the irritating smell and can be applied to various kinds of beverage and food by using a specific [omega]-alkylsulfinylalkykl isothiocyanate as an active ingredient. This antimicrobial and antifungal agent comprises an [omega]-alkylsulfinylalkyl isothiocyanate represented by the formula: R&#x2014;S(O)&#x2014;(CH2)n &#x2014;NCS (n is 1-10; R is a 1-4C alkyl). In an embodiment, this isothiocyanate is 3-methylsulfinylpropyl isothiocyanate, 6-methylsulfinyl-propyl isothiocyanate or the like. The compound in formula I where n is &#x3c;=7 is included in the flavour components of horse radish, but its content is low. The compound of the formula is prepared by oxidizing [omega]-methylthioalkyl isothiocyanate of the formula: CH3 S&#x2014;(CH2)n &#x2014;NCS with a peroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">JP2000086414 A (KINJIRUSHI WASABI KK) discloses how to obtain an antimicrobial agent containing an aromatic component of horseradish as an active ingredient, esp. showing an antibacterial spectrum broadly ranging from fungi to bacteria, and exerting a strong bacteriostatic and antibacterial effect even with an infinitesimal content of the aromatic component. The agent comprises, as an active ingredient, an aromatic component of horseradish of n-methylsulfonylalkylisothiocyanate and one or more aromatic components of horseradish selected from the group consisting of n-methylthioalkyl isothiocyanate, n-methylsulfinylalkyl isothiocyanate, and allyl isothiocyanate. The agent comprises, as an active ingredient, aromatic components of horseradish of both n-methylthioalkyl isothiocyanate and n-methylsulfinylalkyl isothiocyanate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">K. GILLIVER &#x201c;The Inhibitory Action of Antibiotics on Plant Pathogenic Bacteria and Fungi&#x201d;, ANNALS OF BOTANY, vol. 10, no. 3, 1 Jul. 1946 (1946-07-01), pages 271-282, XP55512767, GB ISSN: 0305-7364, DOI: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a083136; reports that example of antagonism between soil micro-organisms and plant pathogens have been recognized for many years; and in some instances biological methods of disease control have been elaborated. Specific antibiotic substances have been isolated from culture filtrates of fungi, bacteria and Actinomycetes, and some of them have been shown to have an antagonistic action against causal organisms of plant diseases. In particular, the antifungal activity of cheiroline is disclosed.</p>

In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and are not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0036">In the case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0037">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in art to which the subject matter herein belongs. As used herein, the following definitions are supplied in order to facilitate the understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0038">The term &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; is generally used in the sense of include, that is to say permitting the presence of one or more features or components.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0039">As used in the specification and claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0040">The presence of broadening words and phrases such as &#x201c;one or more,&#x201d; &#x201c;at least,&#x201d; &#x201c;but not limited to&#x201d; or other like phrases in some instances shall not be read to mean that the narrower case is intended or required in instances where such broadening phrases may be absent.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0041">As used herein the terms &#x201c;subject&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient&#x201d; are well-recognized in the art, and, are used interchangeably herein to refer to a mammal, including dog, cat, rat, mouse, monkey, cow, horse, goat, sheep, pig, camel, and, most preferably, a human. In some embodiments, the subject is a subject in need of treatment or a subject with a disease or disorder. However, in other embodiments, the subject can be a normal subject. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and new-born subjects, whether male or female, are intended to be covered.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0042">The term &#x201c;an effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount necessary to obtain a physiological effect. The physiological effect may be achieved by one application dose or by repeated applications. The dosage administered may, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the physiological characteristics of the particular composition; the age, health and weight of the subject; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; and the effect desired and can be adjusted by a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0043">A &#x201c;fungus&#x201d; is a eukaryote that digests food externally and absorbs nutrients directly through its cell walls. Most fungi reproduce by spores and have a body (thallus) composed of microscopic tubular cells called hyphae. Fungi are heterotrophs and, like animals, obtain their carbon and energy from other organisms. Some fungi obtain their nutrients from a living host (plant or animal) and are called biotrophs; others obtain their nutrients from dead plants or animals and are called saprotrophs (saprophytes, saprobes). Some fungi infect a living host, but kill host cells in order to obtain their nutrients; these are called necrotrophs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0044">&#x201c;Pathogenic fungi&#x201d; also referred herein as &#x201c;fungal pathogens&#x201d; are fungi that cause disease in plants, humans or other organisms. Approximately 300 fungi are known to be pathogenic to humans. The study of fungi pathogenic to humans is called &#x201c;medical mycology&#x201d;. Although fungi are eukaryotic, many pathogenic fungi are microorganisms. The study of fungi and other organisms pathogenic to plants is called plant pathology.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0045">There are thousands of species of plant pathogenic fungi that collectively are responsible for 70% of all known plant diseases. Plant pathogenic fungi are parasites, but not all plant parasitic fungi are pathogens. Plant parasitic fungi obtain nutrients from a living plant host, but the plant host doesn't necessarily exhibit any symptoms. Plant pathogenic fungi are parasites and cause disease characterized by symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0046">&#x201c;Fungicides&#x201d; are biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms used to kill parasitic fungi or their spores (defined herein as fungitoxic). A fungistatic inhibits their growth. Fungi can cause serious damage in agriculture, resulting in critical losses of yield, quality, and profit. Fungicides are used both in agriculture and medicine to fight fungal infections in animals or humans. Chemicals used to control oomycetes, which are not fungi, are also referred to as fungicides, as oomycetes use the same mechanisms as fungi to infect plants. Fungicides can either be contact, translaminar or systemic. Contact fungicides are not taken up into the plant tissue and protect only the plant where the spray is deposited. Translaminar fungicides redistribute the fungicide from the upper, sprayed leaf surface to the lower, unsprayed surface. Systemic fungicides are taken up and redistributed through the xylem vessels. Few fungicides move to all parts of a plant. Some are locally systemic, and some move upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0047">&#x201c;Fungistatics&#x201d; are anti-fungal agents that inhibit the growth of fungus (without killing the fungus). The term fungistatic may be used as both a noun and an adjective. Fungistatics have applications in agriculture, the food industry, the paint industry, and medicine.</p>

If sulphur has not been reduced nor oxidized; it possesses 6 valence electron.

<p id="p-0055" num="0076">The term &#x201c;lone pair&#x201d; refers to a pair of valence electrons that are not shared with another atom and is sometimes called a non-bonding pair. Lone pairs are found in the outermost electron shell of atoms. They can be identified by using a Lewis structure. Electron pairs are therefore considered lone pairs if two electrons are paired but are not used in chemical bonding. Thus, the number of lone pair electrons plus the number of bonding electrons equals the total number of valence electrons around an atom. A single lone pair can be found with atoms in the nitrogen group such as nitrogen in ammonia, two lone pairs can be found with atoms in the chalcogen group such as oxygen in water and the halogens can carry three lone pairs such as in hydrogen chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0077">A &#x201c;covalent bond&#x201d;, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0078">&#x201c;Isothiocyanate&#x201d; is the chemical group &#x2014;N&#x2550;C&#x2550;S, formed by substituting the oxygen in the isocyanate group with a sulphur. Many natural isothiocyanates from plants are produced by enzymatic conversion of metabolites called glucosinolates. These natural isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocyanate, are also known as mustard oils. An artificial isothiocyanate, phenyl isothiocyanate, is used for amino acid sequencing in the Edman degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0079">The term &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; as used herein refers to saturated and unsaturated aliphatic groups, including straight-chain alkyl groups, branched-chain alkyl groups, optionally substituted with one or several halogens. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has about 30 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>30 </sub>for straight chain, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>30 </sub>for branched chain), and alternatively, about 20 or fewer, e.g. from 1 to 6 carbons (defined as lower alkyl). Preferably, alkyls of the invention, have one to thirty, more preferably one to twenty, even more preferably one to twelve, more preferably one to eight, more preferably one to six, and most preferably from one to four carbon atoms and is linear or branched.

<p id="p-0064" num="0085">The term &#x201c;carbocycle&#x201d; represents an aromatic or a saturated or a partially saturated 5-14 membered monocyclic or polycyclic ring, such as a 5- to 7-membered monocyclic or 7- to 10-membered bicyclic ring, wherein all the ring members are carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0086">The term &#x201c;polycyclic&#x201d; refers to a polycyclic ring system, wherein at least two rings are connected together. As used herein, &#x201c;polycyclic&#x2019; refers to any ring system, which may be any degree of saturation, aromatic, aliphatic and optionally contain a heteroatom. The systems can be further classified according to the number of rings present (e.g., 2=bicyclic, 3=tricyclic, 4=tetracyclic, etc.) and the way the rings are connected together.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0087">(1) Substituted rings systems: These ring systems have no common atoms. In these polycyclic systems, the smaller ring can be regarded as a substituent of the larger ring. By way of example only, biphenyl is a substituted polycyclic ring system.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0088">(2) Spiro ring systems: Spiro ring systems share a single common atom. Hence the rings join at a single &#x201c;point.&#x201d; The connecting atom is also called the spiroatom, most often a quaternary carbon (&#x201c;spiro carbon&#x201d;). By way of example, the spiro compound consisting of a cyclohexane ring and a cyclopentane ring is called spiro[4.5]decane.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0089">(3) Fused ring systems: Fused ring systems share two common atoms in one common bond, hence the rings share one side. Examples of fused polycyclic ring systems include, but are not limited to, Naphthalene, Benzofuran, Indole, Benzothiophene, Quinoline and Anthracene.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0090">(4) Bridged ring systems: Bridged ring systems share more than two common atoms, i.e., bridged ring systems contain interlocking rings. By way of example, Adamantane, Amantadine, Biperiden, Memantine, Methenamine, Rimantadine and Norbornane are all bridged ring systems.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0207">The fungicide composition according to the invention can be used in various forms such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil, encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas (under pressure), gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate, macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment, seed coated with a pesticide, soluble concentrate, soluble powder, solution for seed treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra-low volume (ULV) liquid, ultra-low volume (ULV) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder. These compositions include not only compositions that are ready to be applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions that must be diluted before application to the crop.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0208">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the composition can be specifically applied on fruits and vegetables in storage facilities with an ultrasonic fogger. The ultrasonic fogger is a device that is using ultrasonic sound waves to break water into very small droplets (&#x3c;10 um) and sprays it into the air as a dense cold fog (i.e. not resulting from boiling water). Examples of ultrasonic foggers and systems are i.e. described in the following U.S. Patents: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,042,016; 4,058,253; 4,118,945; 4,564,375; 4,667,465; 4,702,074; 4,731,990; 4,731,998; 4,773,846; 5,454,518; 6,854,661. Usually an ultrasonic fogger includes: a generally cylindrical body having an axial bore with an outlet at a front face of the body; a gas supply and a liquid supply coupled to the bore; at least a portion of the front face having a curved convex contour, the front face having a flat central annular region surrounding the outlet of the bore; and a resonator spaced from and opposing the outlet end of the bore. Such devices are commonly used to control humidity level in greenhouses, to deliver nutrients to plant in aeroponic cultures or to create optimal humidity levels in houses.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0209">Applicants demonstrated that this technique can be used to apply products used for the extension of fruits and vegetables freshness in storage facilities e.g. natural fungicides. This technology, permits to efficiently treat fruits and vegetables that are not accessible to the treatments applied by spray or other applications, due to their packaging (i.e. it cannot be easily sprayed directly because fruits and vegetables are stored e.g. in container or because spraying might damage the fruits and vegetables).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0210">Interestingly, Applicants performed efficacy trials on fruits and vegetables in a storage facility of 30 m<sup>3 </sup>using an industrial MHS15 Ultrasonic Humidifiers (http://www.mainlandmart.com/humidify.html), generating 15 kg of fog/hour made of droplets of a size comprised between 1-10 &#x3bc;m with average 5 micron. The composition of the invention, represented by powder was added into water container of the fogger in a dosage of 400-600 &#x3bc;M, depending on the tested plant species. Powder was dissolved in the water and applied on the fruits in a form of cold vapor. Applicants, have confirmed equal distribution of the product on all treated crops and easy access to the inaccessible previously parts of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0211">The fungicide composition according to the invention can also be mixed with one or more insecticides, pesticides, attractants, sterilants, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, other fungicides, growth regulators, herbicides, fertilizers, safeners, semiochemicals, flavour exhauster agents or other compounds with biological activity. The mixtures thus obtained have normally a broadened spectrum of activity. The mixtures with other fungicide compounds are particularly advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0212">The fungicide composition according to the invention comprising a mixture with a bactericide compound can also be particularly advantageous. Examples of suitable bactericide mixing partners can be selected in the following list: bronopol, dichlorophen, nitrapyrin, nickel dimethyldithiocarbamate, kasugamycin, octhilinone, furancarboxylic acid, oxytetracycline, probenazole, streptomycin, tecloftalam, copper sulfate and other copper preparations.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0213">The dose of the fungicide composition usually applied in the treatment according to the invention is generally and advantageously from 10 to 800 g/ha, preferably from 50 to 300 g/ha for applications in foliar treatment. The dose of fungicide composition applied is generally and advantageously from 2 to 200 g per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 3 to 150 g per 100 kg of seed in the case of seed treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0214">It is clearly understood that the doses indicated herein are given as illustrative examples of the treatment method according to the invention. A person skilled in the art will know how to adapt the application doses, notably according to the nature of the plant or crop to be treated. Glucosinolates are sulfur- and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites that are present in the order of Capparales, which includes agronomically important Brassicaceae family. Approximately 200 glucosinolates were described, so far. All of them can be subdivided on three major groups based on their amino acids precursors: aliphatic, indolic and aromatic glucosinolates. The role of these metabolites in plants is not fully understood, however they were shown to be involved in defence responses against herbivores, some fungal (Schreiner and Koide, 1993) and bacterial pathogens (Dufour et al., 2015). Glucosinolates are not active in intact form, however, during tissue damage e.g. herbivore attack, they are broken down to three major bioactive compounds: nitriles, thiocyanates, and isothiocyanates by myrosinase enzyme. All three active compounds were shown to be toxic to a large group of plant pathogens (Lambrix et al., 2001). In this study, Applicants had surprisingly revealed a new role of aliphatic glucosinolates, specifically methylsulfonyl and methylsulfinyl straight alkyl chain compounds (CH<sub>3</sub>S(O)<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>) in toxicity to fungal pathogens.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0215">For this purpose, Applicants selected <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>mutants affected in the cuticle composition and performed fungi toxicity assays using <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>&#x2014;a second agronomically important fungal pathogen, for which no efficient organic treatment exists to date. Based on the obtained results, the following mutants revealed strong resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i>: fatty acid desaturase mutants (fad2; fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8), a cytochromes P450 belonging to CYP77 family/defensive in cuticle ridges (cyp77 dcr), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase/permeable cuticle 1 (gpat6 pec1) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (gpat4 gpat8) double knockout mutants. All of selected mutants displayed a strong resistance against <i>B. cinerea </i>either only at the cotyledon stage (fad mutants) or at both seedlings and adult stages (cyp77 dcr; gpat6 pec1; gpat4 gpat8 double mutants). To understand what leads to fungal resistance in these plants, diverse approaches were used e.g. molecular biology, microscopy and biochemistry. Testing for the currently known mechanisms that are involved in <i>B. cinerea </i>resistance, i.e. hormonal changes, higher ROS levels and surface modification, could not fully explain <i>B. cinerea </i>resistance. These results lead Applicants to the use of surface metabolomics approach to identify potential antifungal compounds on the plant surface. With the help of this technic, Applicants were able to identify 2 compounds strongly abundant on the surface of different cuticle mutants: 7-methylsulfonyl-heptyl glucosinolate (on the cotyledons of fad2 mutants), to Applicant's knowledge not identified earlier in <i>Arabidopsis </i>plants, and 8-methylsulfonyl-octyl glucosinolate (on the cotyledons of fad3-2 fad7-2fad8 and leaves of gpat6 pec1 mutants). Focusing on the general structure of the first identified compounds led Applicants to the identification of 2 major groups of aliphatic glucosinolates and their mixtures strongly involved in fungal resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0150" num="0218"><i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>accession Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as the wild type (WT) plant. The following alleles in Col-0 background were received from the <i>Arabidopsis </i>Biological Resource Centre (ABRC): fad2-1 (CS8041), fad2-3 (SK18137), the fad2-1 fad6 and fad2-3 fad6 were obtained by crossing of the single mutants in this work. Double mutant gpat4 gpat8 was kindly provided by Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric Beisson, fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 seeds were offered by John Browse, cyp77 der and gpat6 pec1 double mutants were kindly provided by Dr. Christiane Nawrath. Before planting seeds were stratified for 2 days at 40&#xb0; C. and then grown at 21&#xb0; C. under 100 &#x3bc;E m-2 s-1 of light with photoperiods depending on the application (experiments with seedlings: 14 h light, 10 h dark (long day); on soil for seed propagation: 24 h light, continuous day).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0219">Seedlings used for experiments were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog solid media (0.5*MS, 2.15 g/L, pH 5.7; Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Nederlands) supplemented with 0.5 g/L of MES hydrate (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) and 0.7% plant agar (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland). After stratification seeds were placed on the nylon mesh (200 &#x3bc;m pore size; product number AH03444, Lanz-Anliker AG, Rohrbach, Switzerland) to provide solid support for uniform seedling germination and growth. All the chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0221">Christiane Nawrath and Prof. Michael Hahn, respectively. The fungus was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 10 days. Conidia were filtered and diluted to 5*105 spores/&#x3bc;l in &#xbd; strength potato dextrose broth (PDB). 2 &#x3bc;l of this suspension were applied on 7-day-old <i>Arabidopsis </i>cotyledons grown in petri dishes. Infected seedlings were incubated for 48 h in long day conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0222">Methylsulfonyl and methylsulfinyl nitrile and thiocyanates were obtained from SpiroChem (Basel, Switzerland), methylsulfonyl and methylsulfinyl isothiocyanates from SpiroChem and LKT LABS (Minnesota, United States of America). All the obtained compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Fungal strains used during for in vitro fungal bioassay were obtained from the mycotheca of Agroscope (www.mycoscone.bcis.ch).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0223">Pure cultures of different species of plant fungal pathogens were inoculated on PDA implemented with by-products of aliphatic glucosinolates that were preliminary dissolved to various concentration (e.g. 10, 100, 250, 400, 550, 700, 850, 1100, 1400 &#x3bc;M) in PDB and placed on the 24 well plates (VWR International, Dietikon, Switzerland). Controls were treated in similar way with DMSO alone. 2 mm agar plug (Dufour et al. 2015) of a fungal pre-culture were placed on each well, 3 biological replicates were used for each concentration. Plates were incubated for the period of one week in the phytotron (80% relative humidity, constant temperature of 23&#xb0; C., under alternating 16 h day and 8 h night cycles).

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Metabolomics Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0224">The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QTOF-MS) on an Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) to a Synapt G2 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer mass spectrometer (QTOF; Waters) was used to carry out this experiment. An Acquity UPLC ethylene bridge hybrid (BEH) C18 column (50&#xd7;2.1 mm, 1.7 m; Waters) was employed at a flow rate of 400 &#x3bc;L/min and maintained at a temperature of 25&#xb0; C. The following gradient was used with 0.05% formic acid in water as mobile phase A and 0.05% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase B: 0.0-7.0 min 2-100% B, 7.0-9.0 min 100% B, 9.0-11.0 min 2% B. The injection volume was 2.5 &#x3bc;L. The QTOF was operated in electrospray negative mode using the MS<sup>E </sup>(simultaneous acquisition of full scan and all fragment ions) mode. Mass spectrometric parameters were as follows: mass range 85-1200 Da, scan time 0.2 s, source temperature 120&#xb0; C., capillary voltage &#x2212;2.0 kV, cone voltage &#x2212;25V, extraction cone &#x2212;4.5 V, de-solvation gas flow and temperature 800 L/h and 400&#xb0; C., respectively, cone gas flow 20 L/h, collision energy 4 eV (low energy acquisition function) and 10-35 eV (high energy acquisition function), collision gas (argon) 7&#xd7;10-3 mbars. A 400 ng/mL solution of the synthetic peptide leucine-enkephaline in water: acetonitrile: formic acid (50:50:0.1) was infused constantly into the mass spectrometer as internal reference to ensure accurate mass measurements. Data were recorded by Masslynx v.4.1 (Waters). Marker detection was performed using Markerlynx XS (Waters) with the following parameters: initial and final retention time 0.0 and 9.0 min, mass range 85-1200 Da, mass window 0.02 Da, retention time window 0.06 min, intensity threshold 500 counts, automatic peak width and peak-to-peak baseline noise calculation, de-isotoping function applied. Data were mean&#x2014;centered and Pareto&#x2014;scaled before applying principal component analysis. Markers of interest were tentatively identified based on their molecular formula determination and fragments obtained by collision-induced dissociation.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0225">The 7-methylsulfonyl-heptyl glucosinolate was identified on the surface of fatty acid desaturase 2 (fad2-3) <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>mutant that revealed strong resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>at the cotyledon stage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Confirmation of antifungal activity of 7-methylsulfonyl-heptyl isothiocyanate (7MSOOH, the only commercially available by-product of 7-methylsulfonyl-heptyl glucosinolate) against <i>B. cinerea </i>and other fungal pathogens was performed in vitro by direct application of isothiocyanate in potato dextrose agar in different dosages. Obtained results reveled no fungitoxic activity of this compound against <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>in the dose range between 10 and 1500 &#x3bc;M. Higher dosages were not applied, due to the potential toxic effect of this compound. However, performance of bioassay on other fungal pathogens allowed to identify that 7-methylsulfonyl-heptyl isothiocyanate is fungitoxic to some fungal species, as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0227">Conclusion: 7-methylsulfonyl-heptyl isothiocyanate reveals a narrow range of fungitoxic activity on a few plant fungal pathogens and shows to be non-active on broadly spread plant fungal pathogens as <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>(Grey mold) or <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>. However, Applicants have surprisingly shown that the combination of glucosinolates' by-products leads to strong fungitoxic activity on a large number of agronomical important fungal pathogens (43 species, see table on pages 23-24 for the list of species).</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0160" num="0228">Investigation of other natural by-products of glucosinolates and their combinations led Applicants to identify highly efficient antifungal mixtures of compounds. Applicants used the effective dose that produces a quantitative effect in 95% of the population (ED95) at the maximal concentration of 1500 &#x3bc;M to investigate the fungitoxic activity of analyzed compounds. Applicants have chosen two most broadly spread plant fungal pathogens to perform toxicity assay: <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>(pathogen of 1400 plant species) and <i>Fusarium oxysporum </i>(pathogen of a large number of plant species e.g. tomato, bananas). Selection of such fungal pathogens was caused by the absence of any efficient organic treatment (less than 60% of efficiency) on the market that creates a need for identifying new efficient products which can be used by farmers with no risk for their health and also for the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0229">Initially, applicants had tested single molecules of 8-methylsulfonyl-octyl- (8MSOOH) and 8-methylsulfinyl-octyl- (8MSOH) isothiocyanates that revealed no fungitoxic effect on <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>and <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>. However, once 8-methylsulfonyl-octyl- (8MSOOH) and 8-methylsulfinyl-octyl-isothiocyanate (8MSOH) are combined together they become highly toxic to <i>B. cinerea </i>(1400 &#x3bc;M) and <i>F. oxysporum </i>(923.64 &#x3bc;M).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0230">Surprisingly, toxicity assay with 8-methylsulfonyl-octyl-nitrile (8MSOON) and 8-methylsulfonyl-octyl-isothiocyanate (8MSOOH) revealed different effect on two fungal species. Combination of nitrile and isothiocyanates was toxic to <i>B. cinerea </i>in the dosage of 850 &#x3bc;M (lower than the combination of the two isothiocyanates). However, this combination had mild effect on the development on <i>F. oxysporum</i>. For this fungal pathogen, the fungitoxic effect was obtained with the combination of 8MSOOH+8MSOH, with an EC95 of 923.64 &#x3bc;M.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0231">Combination of three molecules together (isothiocyanates and nitriles) did not lead to an increase in the fungitoxic activities of these molecules and stayed at the same level than the one with the most efficient combination of the 2 molecules. Results of single and combinations of molecules are presented in Table 2.</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0233">Conclusion: By-products of methylsulfonyl and methylsulfinyl glucosinolates used separately reveal no fungitoxic activity on most broadly spread plant fungal pathogens at the tested concentrations. However, performing combinations of methylsulfonyl isothiocyanates with methylsulfonyl nitriles, thiocyanates or methylsulfinyl isothiocyanates can lead to fungitoxic activities.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0166" num="0234">Examination of other aliphatic isothiocyanates led Applicants to test combinations of 6-Methylsulfonylhexyl isothiocyanates (6MSOOH) with: 6-methylsulfinylhexyl (6MSOH), 4-methylsulfinylbutyl (4MSOH), 8-methylsulfinyloctyl (8MSOH) and 8-methylsulfonyloctyl (8MSOOH) isothiocyanates for their fungitoxic effect on <i>Fusarium gramineum </i>(pathogen of barley and wheat) and <i>Phytophthora cactorum </i>(pathogen of 200 plant species).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0235">Applicants had revealed that performing combinations with poorly active compounds could surprisingly lead to an increased fungitoxic activity on a large number of fungal pathogens. For example, both 6MSOOH and 6MSOH are not fungistatic to <i>Fusarium gramineum </i>in the dosage of 1500 &#x3bc;M. However, when applied in a mixture (combination of 6MSOOH and 6MSOH) they become highly fungitoxic with the effective dose at 116.8 &#x3bc;M that produces a quantitative effect in 50% of the population (ED<sub>50</sub>). Similar effects were observed with the other combinations on both fungal species.</p>

<p id="p-0169" num="0237">Conclusion: Combination of methylsulfonyl and methylsulfinyl isothiocyanates with different carbon chain lengths is revealing strong fungitoxic properties against a broad range of fungal pathogens. These results lead to the development of novel, natural organic products that can be used in agriculture, for example in the prevention of pathogen infections. Development of new combinations of products is particularly helpful in reducing the use of chemical pesticides as well as the doses. Besides, due to their high efficiency these new combinations are very helpful in promoting development of bio farming.</p>

Applicants have chosen the second most broadly spread plant fungal pathogens to perform toxicity assay&#x2014;<i>Botrytis cinerea </i>(pathogen of 1400 plant species), due to its worldwide distribution and to not sufficient amount of efficient organic products to treat this fungal pathogen.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0271">Initially, Applicants has chosen 4 compounds that were shown to be fungitoxic on a broad number of fungal pathogens e.g. <i>Phytophthora infestans, Fusarium gramineum: </i>5-methylsulfonyl-pentyl- (5MSOOH), 5-methylsulfinyl-pentyl- (5MSOH), 8-methylsulfonyl-octyl-(8MSOOH) and 8-methylsulfinyl-octyl- (8MSOH) isothiocyanates. However, none of these single compounds revealed fungitoxic effect on <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. To enhance anti-<i>Botrytis </i>properties Applicants performed combinations with 5MSOOH, 5MSOH, 8MSOOH and 8MSOH compounds. Surprisingly, only two combinations revealed anti-fungal properties: first, 8MSOOH with 8MSOH (ED95 of 1400 &#x3bc;M) and second, 8MSOH with 5MSOOH that became highly toxic to <i>B. cinerea </i>in a dosage of 550 &#x3bc;M.

<p id="p-0205" num="0273">Conclusion: By-products of glucosinolates such as methylsulfonyl and methylsulfinyl isothiocyanates used separately reveal no strong fungitoxic activity on the most broadly spread plant fungal pathogen&#x2014;<i>Botrytis cinerea </i>at the tested concentrations. However, performing combinations of compounds having diverse carbon lengths and presenting sulfinyl or sulfonyl groups lead to strong fungitoxic activities at low dosages thus enhancing the fungitoxic effect compared to combinations of molecules having the same carbon lengths and presenting only differences in term of functional groups (i.e. sulfinyl and sulfonyl groups).</p>

<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<p id="p-0210" num="0278">Fungitoxic activities of combined isothiocyanates in three necrotrophic fungal species Applicants examined fungitoxic activities of combined isothiocyanates in three necrotrophic fungal species, i.e. <i>Alternaria radicina </i>(class: Dothideomycetes; order: Pleosporales; host: carrot), <i>Fusarium gramineum </i>(class: Sordariomycetes; order: Hypocreales; host: cereals) and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina </i>(class: Sordariomycetes; order: Glomerellales; host: tomato and cucurbits). Overall, a total of 133 combinations were tested on the three fungal species.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0279">Isothiocyanates were obtained from SpiroChem (Basel, Switzerland) and LKT LABS (Minnesota, United States of America). All the obtained compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Fungal strains used for in vitro fungal bioassay were obtained from the mycotheca of Agroscope (www.mycoscope.bcis.ch).</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0280">Fungitoxic activities were tested in 48 well tissue culture plates. In more details, plant fungal pathogens were inoculated on PDA implemented with isothiocyanates that were preliminary dissolved to various concentration (10, 150, 250, 375, 500, 700, 850 &#x3bc;M) in PDB. 2 mm agar plug (Dufour et al. 2015) of a fungal pre-culture were placed on each well, 3 biological replicates were used for each concentration. Plates were incubated for the period of one week in the phytotron (80% relative humidity, constant temperature of 23&#xb0; C., under alternating 16 h day and 8 h night cycles). Mycelia growth was measured after 7 days using ImageJ (http://imagej.net/Welcome), ED<sub>50 </sub>was evaluated as described in Schnee et al., 2013. Synergistic fungitoxic activities was then estimated as in Chou (2006), and the CompuSyn software (www.combosyn.com) was used to determine the Combination Index (CI) for combinations of two molecules and the presence of synergism (CI&#x3c;1). The results obtained for the best combinations for each fungal species are summarized in Table 6, 7 and 8. It shows the ED<sub>50 </sub>(in &#x3bc;M) obtained for the two molecules alone, for the combination of them (always smaller), and the lower Combination Index for at least one given concentration in a range varying from 10 to 850 &#x3bc;M. All CI listed in the table below being lower than 0.26, it indicates that the combined molecules have strong synergisms and are efficient against the tested fungal species.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0281">Additional molecules used in these combinations are: 1-(isothiocyanatomethyl)-3-(4-(methylsulfinyl)butyl)benzene (8ASOH), 1-(isothiocyanatomethyl)-3-(4-(methylsulfonyl)butyl)benzene (8ASOOH), (E)-1-isothiocyanato-8-(methylsulfinyl)oct-2-ene (8CSOH), 1-(ethylsulfinyl)-8-isothiocyanatooctane (8ESOH), 1-(ethylsulfonyl)-isothiocyanatooctane (8ESOOH), 1-Isothiocyanato-3-(methylsulfinyl)-propane (3MSOH), 1-Isothiocyanato-3-(methylsulfonyl)-propane (3MSOOH), 1-Isothiocyanato-9-(methylsulfinyl)-nonane (9MSOH) and 1-Isothiocyanato-9-(methylsulfonyl)-nonane (9MSOOH).</p>

<p id="p-0224" num="0292">1-Isothiocyanato-8-(methylsulfonyl)-octane and 1-Isothiocyanato-8-(methylsulfinyl)-octane were obtained from SpiroChem (Basel, Switzerland). The compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0293">Fungitoxic activity was tested in 48 well tissue culture plates. Thamnidium <i>elegans </i>was inoculated on PDA implemented with isothiocyanates that were preliminary dissolved to various concentration (10, 150, 250, 375, 500, 700, 850 &#x3bc;M) in PDB. 2 mm agar plugs (Dufour et al. 2015) of a fungal pre-culture were placed on each well, 3 biological replicates were used for each concentration. Plates were incubated for the period of one week in a phytotron (80% relative humidity, constant temperature of 23 OC, under alternating 16 h day and 8 h night cycles). Mycelia growth was measured after 7 days using ImageJ (http://imagej.net/Welcome), EC50 was evaluated as described in Schnee et al., 2013.</p>
