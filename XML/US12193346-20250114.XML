<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to the Figures generally, a turf aerator is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. The turf aerator includes a tine assembly that is movable between an operating position, where tines perforate soil underneath the aerator, and a retracted position, in which the tines do not perforate the soil. To move the tine assembly between the operating position and the retracted position, an operator can use single motions, with either one hand or one foot engaging with a component of the aerator. In addition, the linkages between an operator interface and the components of the aerator are more rigid in nature, as compared to cables or other flexible linkages that may be used on conventional aerators. In this way, the operation of the aerator is simplified for the operator, and breakages of components, such as cables or other linkages, may be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>8</b>C</figref> show a turf aerator according to one embodiment <b>100</b> of the current disclosure. The aerator <b>100</b> includes a frame <b>110</b> with front and rear ends <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>and a plurality of wheels <b>112</b> operatively coupled to the frame <b>110</b>. Two front wheels <b>112</b><i>a </i>and two rear wheels <b>112</b><i>b </i>are shown in the drawings, though more or fewer wheels <b>112</b> may be included. As is known in the art, the wheels <b>112</b> may be powered by an engine or motor, hydraulically, et cetera.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A retracting tine assembly <b>120</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> through <b>8</b>A</figref>, is movable between an operating position <b>120</b><i>a </i>at which tines <b>122</b> of the tine assembly <b>120</b> may be used to perforate soil with small holes and a retracted position <b>120</b><i>b </i>at which the tines <b>122</b> will not intersect the ground. The tine assembly <b>120</b> broadly includes a tine crank <b>121</b> rotatably supported by the frame <b>110</b>, a plurality of the tines <b>122</b> coupled to the tine crank <b>121</b>, a pair of retractor plate swing arms <b>125</b>, a retractor plate <b>128</b> for positioning the tines <b>122</b>, a keeper bar <b>131</b>, a latch <b>135</b>, an input mechanism, such as a release handle <b>141</b>, release cable <b>143</b>, linkage <b>151</b>, and another input mechanism, such as a pedal <b>159</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As known in the art, the tine crank <b>121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, and <b>8</b>A</figref>) may be powered (i.e., rotated) by a belt and pulley or chain and sprocket powered by an engine or motor, by a hydraulic motor, battery pack(s) of a variety of different chemistries, such as lithium-ion, nickel cadmium, lead acid, nickel-metal hydride, et cetera, or otherwise as currently known or later developed. And the tines <b>122</b> may be any desired aerating tines, whether now know or later developed, which may be coupled to and operated by the tine crank <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pair of retractor plate swing arms <b>125</b> are rotatably supported by the frame <b>110</b> at pivot points <b>126</b> located at opposite sides of the frame <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>). The retractor plate <b>128</b> is fixed (directly or indirectly) to the swing arms <b>125</b> and defines a plurality of openings <b>129</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>) through which the tines <b>122</b> pass. The location of the retractor plate <b>128</b> determines whether the tine assembly <b>120</b> is at the operating position <b>120</b><i>a </i>or the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>. More specifically, when the retractor plate <b>128</b> is relatively horizontal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> (the operating position <b>120</b><i>a</i>), the retractor plate <b>128</b> guides the tines <b>122</b> to move toward and away from the ground as the tine crank <b>121</b> rotates; and when the retractor plate <b>128</b> is relatively vertical as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> (the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>), the retractor plate <b>128</b> supports the tines <b>122</b> such that the tines <b>122</b> cannot interact with the ground. The retractor plate <b>128</b> includes slots through which the tines <b>122</b> move to contact the ground when in the operating position <b>120</b><i>a</i>. The retractor plate <b>128</b> can also control how fast the aerator <b>100</b> moves in the forward direction, while also simultaneously helping to propel the aerator <b>100</b> in the direction of movement. When at the operating position <b>120</b><i>a</i>, the tines <b>122</b> are generally located between the rear wheels <b>112</b><i>b </i>and preferably do not extend rearwardly beyond the rear wheels <b>112</b><i>b</i>; and when at the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>, at least some of the tines <b>122</b> preferably extend rearwardly of the rear wheels <b>112</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The keeper bar <b>131</b> engages with the latch <b>135</b> to maintain the tine assembly <b>120</b> at the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>. The keeper bar <b>131</b> is fixed relative to the swing arms <b>125</b> and may extend directly from one or both swing arms <b>125</b> or otherwise be attached to structure extending from one or both swing arms <b>125</b> (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, for example). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A through <b>7</b>C</figref>, a hook portion <b>136</b> of the latch <b>135</b> interacts with the keeper bar <b>131</b> to maintain the retractor plate <b>128</b> relatively vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The latch <b>135</b> is rotatably coupled to the frame <b>110</b> at pivot point <b>137</b> and is biased to hold the keeper bar <b>131</b> by a spring <b>138</b> (e.g., a mechanical spring, gas spring, hydraulic spring, et cetera), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>. And the input mechanism or release handle <b>141</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) interacts with the latch <b>135</b> through the release cable <b>143</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A through <b>8</b>C</figref>. More particularly, one end of the cable <b>143</b> is coupled to the handle <b>141</b> and another end of the cable <b>143</b> terminates at a striker <b>144</b>. A spring <b>145</b> biases the striker <b>144</b> in a direction that that does not urge the hook portion <b>136</b> to disengage the keeper bar <b>131</b>. Yet sufficient input from the release handle <b>141</b> to the cable <b>143</b> causes the striker <b>144</b> to overcome the force of the spring <b>145</b> (and the force of the spring <b>138</b>), rotating the latch <b>135</b> about the pivot point <b>137</b> and releasing the keeper bar <b>131</b> from the hook portion <b>136</b>. With the keeper bar <b>131</b> released from the hook portion <b>136</b>, gravity causes the retractor plate <b>128</b> to move to be relatively horizontal (and thus the swing arms <b>125</b> to rotate about the pivot points <b>126</b>), such that the tine assembly <b>120</b> is at the operating position <b>120</b><i>a</i>. A shield <b>149</b> may be rotatably supported (directly or indirectly) by at least one of the swing arms <b>125</b> so that the shield <b>149</b> lowers to provide a buffer between the tines <b>122</b> and the operator when the tine assembly <b>120</b> is at the operating position <b>120</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The linkage <b>151</b> is provided to move the tine assembly <b>120</b> from the operating position <b>120</b><i>a </i>to the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>. One end <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the linkage <b>151</b> terminates at the input mechanism or pedal <b>159</b>, and another end <b>151</b><i>b </i>of the linkage <b>151</b> is directly or indirectly rotatably coupled to the swing arm <b>125</b> (in the embodiment <b>100</b>, the end <b>151</b><i>b </i>is coupled to the keeper bar <b>131</b> and has an axis of rotation that is coaxial with the keeper bar <b>131</b>; this arrangement may be particularly desirable). The pedal end <b>151</b><i>a </i>may be coupled to (e.g., through welding, bolts, or any other appropriate fastener) or form the pedal <b>159</b>. While the linkage <b>151</b> may be configured in various ways, it may be particularly desirable for the linkage <b>151</b> to include a driving link <b>152</b> associated with the pedal end <b>151</b><i>a </i>and a driven link <b>156</b> operable by the driving link <b>152</b>. The driving link <b>152</b> is rotatably coupled to the frame <b>110</b> at pivot point <b>153</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>), and a biasing member <b>154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) biases the driving link <b>152</b> such that the pedal <b>159</b> is typically raised. A distal end of the driving link <b>152</b> includes a pin or other sliding element <b>155</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) for interacting with the driven link <b>156</b>, and the driven link <b>156</b> includes a sliding slot <b>157</b> which interacts with the sliding element <b>155</b>. The driven link <b>156</b> forms the link end <b>151</b><i>b </i>and is coupled to the keeper bar <b>131</b> about axis of rotation <b>158</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In use, the tine assembly <b>120</b> may start at the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>A through <b>7</b>C</figref>), with the keeper bar <b>131</b> held by the latch <b>135</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A through <b>7</b>C</figref>). The aerator <b>100</b> may be easily transported when the tine assembly <b>120</b> is at the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>, as the tines <b>122</b> cannot interact with the ground. When the operator desires to use the tines <b>122</b>, the tine assembly <b>120</b> may be quickly moved to the operating position <b>120</b><i>a </i>by actuating the release handle <b>141</b>. Actuation of the release handle <b>141</b> causes the cable <b>143</b> to move the striker <b>144</b>, overcoming the force of the spring <b>145</b> and the spring <b>138</b> and rotating the latch <b>135</b> about the pivot point <b>137</b> to release the keeper bar <b>131</b> from the hook portion <b>136</b>. With the keeper bar <b>131</b> released from the hook portion <b>136</b>, gravity causes the retractor plate <b>128</b> to move to be relatively horizontal (and the swing arms <b>125</b> to rotate about the pivot points <b>126</b>), such that the tine assembly <b>120</b> is at the operating position <b>120</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Movement of the aerator <b>100</b> from the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b </i>to the operating position <b>120</b><i>a </i>occurs in a single motion by the operator and can be performed without starting or stopping the engine. Moving conventional aerators into an operating position may require three separate steps: (1) engaging the clutch mechanism, (2) moving a lever to lower the tines into an operating position, and (3) grabbing a forward direction control to operate the aerator in a forward direction. While performing these steps, an operator must know the sequence in which to perform the steps and must perform the steps relatively quickly. On the contrary, the aerator <b>100</b> described herein allows for a single, fluid motion to move the tine assembly <b>120</b> into an operating position <b>120</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the operator does not need to know a certain sequence for performing the steps and does not need to try to perform three different movements in a quick sequence. Instead, using only one hand, the operator can actuate the release handle <b>141</b> to move the aerator <b>100</b> into the operating position <b>120</b><i>a </i>as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To return the tine assembly <b>120</b> to the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>, an operator steps upon the pedal <b>159</b> and rotates the driving link <b>152</b> (e.g., steel linkage) about the pivot point <b>153</b>. Rotation of the driving link <b>152</b> causes the sliding element <b>155</b> to move along the sliding slot <b>157</b>, ultimately raising the linkage end <b>151</b><i>b </i>(and rotating the swing arm <b>125</b>) and positioning the keeper bar <b>131</b> to be held by the latch <b>135</b>. Rotation of the swing arm <b>125</b> rotates the retractor plate <b>128</b>, forcing the tines <b>122</b> to be pointed such that they cannot intersect the ground. In some embodiments, the input mechanism or pedal <b>159</b> can be a hand lever that is operable using a single hand.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, the pedal <b>159</b> is operated solely through a stepping movement such that the operator does not need to use either of his or her hands to operate the pedal <b>159</b> to return the tine assembly <b>120</b> to the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the operator's hands are free to remain engaged with the handles of the aerator <b>100</b> during movement from the operating position <b>120</b><i>a </i>to the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the operator can focus on safely and effectively maneuvering the aerator <b>100</b> during operation. In addition, in situations where the operator may be new to operating the aerator <b>100</b>, the operator does not need to worry about taking his or her hands off of the aerator <b>100</b> during operation and can learn to operate the hydro-static drive capabilities of the aerator <b>100</b>. Conventional aerators may also use a flexible cable linkage to lift a tine assembly out of operation. In contrast, the aerator <b>100</b> uses a solid (e.g., steel) linkage to move the tine assembly <b>120</b> into the retracted position <b>120</b><i>b</i>. As such, the likelihood of a breakage in the linkage, or that the linkage may be snagged on other portions of the aerator <b>100</b> or by an operator, is reduced.</p>
